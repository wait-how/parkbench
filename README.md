# parkbench

A collection of old benchmarks.

## Layout
 - `orig` contains the original source code for all benchmarks.
 - `c` contains versions of all benchmarks modified to eliminate warnings.
    - `dhrystone`: builds
	- `whetstone`: builds
	- `linpack`: builds
	- `livermore-loops`: doesn't build (designed to be run from a Fortran kernel)
